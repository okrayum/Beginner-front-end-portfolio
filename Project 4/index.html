            <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
            <div>
                <p>Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a
                    high
                    level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you
                    are
                    comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                    web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                    you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                    layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                    much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for
                    example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
                    page.</li>
                <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example
                    setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
                    control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but
                    it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>function updateName() {
                            const name = prompt('Enter a new name');
                            para.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
                          }</code>
            </div>

        <section id="Troubleshooting_JavaScript" class="main-section">
            <header>Troubleshooting JavaScript</header>
            <p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that
                you'll come across:</p>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Adipisci beatae totam, aliquam amet
                tenetur
                assumenda quisquam excepturi voluptas provident ad ipsum sed suscipit error. Corporis pariatur
                quos
                molestias vero eaque cum. Tenetur quasi laudantium dicta minima laboriosam necessitatibus unde
                provident sit voluptate soluta veritatis minus, nulla ducimus tempore beatae tempora?
            </p>


            <ul>
                <li>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at
                    all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too.
                    These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the
                    error messages mean!
                </li>
                <li>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you
                    intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are
                    often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the
                    source of the error.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>guessSubmit.addeventListener('click', checkGuess);</code>
            </div>

        </section>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for
                you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a
                high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the
                most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.</p>
            <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might
                use as part of a sentence.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an
                    international audience.</li>
                <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs
                    to
                    mean specific things, so may get confusing.</li>
                <li>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.</li>
                <li>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple
                    words,
                    using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using
                    this
                    for our variable names in the article so far.</li>
                <li>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single
                    letters/numbers, or big long phrases.</li>
                <li>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable from myAge.</li>
                <li>One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by
                    this,
                    we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like var,
                    function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so
                    you'll
                    get errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>var myName;
                        var myAge;</code>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="Basic_math_in_JavaScript" class="main-section">

            <header>Basic math in JavaScript</header>

            <p>At this point in the course we discuss math in JavaScript — how we can use operators and other features
                to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.</p>
            <p>Okay, maybe not. Some of us like math, some of us have hated math ever since we had to learn
                multiplication tables and long division in school, and some of us sit somewhere in between the two. But
                none of us can deny that math is a fundamental part of life that we can't get very far without. This is
                especially true when we are learning to program JavaScript (or any other language for that matter) — so
                much of what we do relies on processing numerical data, calculating new values, and so on, that you
                won't be surprised to learn that JavaScript has a full-featured set of math functions available.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Integers are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative,
                    e.g.
                    10, 400, or -5.</li>
                <li>Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and
                    56.7786543.</li>
                <li>Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard
                    floating
                    point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>
                    const myInt = 5;
                    const myFloat = 6.667;
                    myInt;

        <section id="Handling_text" class="main-section">
            <header>Handling text</header>
            <p>Next, we'll turn our attention to strings — this is what pieces of text are called in programming. In
                this article, we'll look at all the common things that you really ought to know about strings when
                learning JavaScript, such as creating strings, escaping quotes in strings, and joining strings together.
            </p>
            <p>Words are very important to humans — they are a large part of how we communicate. Since the Web is a
                largely text-based medium designed to allow humans to communicate and share information, it is useful
                for us to have control over the words that appear on it. HTML provides structure and meaning to our
                text, CSS allows us to precisely style it, and JavaScript contains a number of features for manipulating
                strings, creating custom welcome messages and prompts, showing the right text labels when needed,
                sorting terms into the desired order, and much more.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
            <header>Arrays</header>
            <p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain
                multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the
                same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list
                individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the
                same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an
                array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the
                prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that
                does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less
                efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would already be annoying,
                but what about 100 items, or 1000? We'll return to this example later on in the article.</p>

        <section id="Conditionals" class="main-section">
            <header>Conditionals</header>
            <p>In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending
                on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over.
                In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon
                if it is nighttime. In this article, we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in
                JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that
                must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the
                outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be
                "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)</p>


            <ul>
                <li>The keyword if followed by some parentheses.</li>
                <li>A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other
                    value?", or "does this value exist?"). The condition makes use of the comparison operators we
                    discussed in the last module and returns true or false.</li>
                <li>A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and it only
                    runs if the condition returns true.</li>
                <li>The keyword else.</li>
                <li>Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and
                    it only runs if the condition is not true — or in other words, the condition is false.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>

            <header>Looping code</header>
            <p>Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic
                calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to
                complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.
            </p>
            <p>Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different
                each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>random(x), defined earlier in the code, returns a whole number between 0 and x-1.</li>
                <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semi-colons:</li>
                <li>Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.

            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a
                single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short
                command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore
                fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and
                parameters.

            <p>In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through
                the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to
                start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The name of the event to listen for, which in this case is keydown</li>
                <li>A function to run when the event happens.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>const myText = 'I am a string';
                const newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');
                console.log(newString);
                </code>
            </div>

            <header>Function return values</header>
            <p>There's one last essential concept about functions for us to discuss — return values. Some functions
                don't return a significant value, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how
                to use them in your code, and how to make functions return useful values. We'll cover all of these
                below.
            </p>
            <p>Return values are just what they sound like — the values that a function returns when it has completed.
                You've already met return values a number of times, although you may not have thought about them
                explicitly.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The substring to find ('cold').</li>
                <li>The string to replace it with ('warm').</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>const myText = 'The weather is cold';
                const newString = myText.replace('cold', 'warm');
                console.log(newString);
                </code>
            </div>

            <header>Introduction to events</header>
            <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells
                you about so your code can react to them.
            </p>
            <p>As mentioned above, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming — the
                system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by
                which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. For
                example, in an airport, when the runway is clear for take off, a signal is communicated to the pilot. As
                a result, the plane can safely take off.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific
                item that resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML document loaded in
                the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.</li>
                <li>The user chooses a key on the keyboard.</li>
                <li>The user resizes or closes the browser window.</li>
                <li>A web page finishes loading.</li>
                <li>A form is submitted.</li>
                <li>A video is played, paused, or finishes.</li>
                <li>An error occurs.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>const btn = document.querySelector('button');
                function random(number) {
                  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number+1));
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of
                loops, functions, conditionals and events by getting you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a
                lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery.
            </p>
            <p>You have been provided with some HTML, CSS and image assets and a few lines of JavaScript code; you need
                to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>It absolutely positions the three elements inside the full-img <div> — the <img> in which the
                        full-sized image is displayed, an empty <div> that is sized to be the same size as the <img> and
                            put right over the top of it (this is used to apply a darkening effect to the image via a
                            semi-transparent background color), and a <button> that is used to control the darkening
                                effect.</li>
                <li>It sets the width of any images inside the thumb-bar <div> (so-called "thumbnail" images) to 20%,
                        and floats them to the left so they sit next to one another on a line.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <code>btn.setAttribute('class', xxx);
                btn.textContent = xxx;
                overlay.style.backgroundColor = xxx;</code>
